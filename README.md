# Tasks

You need to expose functionalities similar to a HRIS system.
You are given a json file containing employee informations.
Your task is to spin up a REST API server locally that can expose these routes:

GET employees/
GET employees/{employee_id}
PATCH employees/{employee_id}
POST employees/{employee_id}

You can choose whatever implementation you want for ingesting and storing the data.
